If you're reading this, you have Git access. Congrats. This file is just a notes file for the timebeing, but a warning: Do NOT make anything in the core that is game-specific. You can implement generic functions, but the point of the Offlink core is to be modular, and to allow for drop-in games.
(Also, the name is an almost direct reference to one of my favorite games, and some of the code may have come from its engine. For that reason, the disclaimer at the bottom of this file exists)
